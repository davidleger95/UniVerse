The band continued to explore new sounds with their self-titled release and enjoyed continued mainstream success before their drummer, James \"The Rev\" Sullivan, died in 2009. Despite his death, the band continued on with help of now-former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy and released and toured in support of their fifth album Nightmare in 2010 which debuted on the top spot of the Billboard 200, their first number one debut.[2] Their latest record Hail to the King released in 2013 marked the only album featuring drummer Arin Ilejay. Hail to the King charted as #1 on the US Billboard 200, the UK albums chart, as well as the Finnish, Brazilian, Canadian, and Irish charts.\r\n\r\nTo date, Avenged Sevenfold has released six studio albums, one live album/compilation/DVD, and eighteen singles and have sold over 3 million albums in the US.','Avenged Sevenfold','Metal','USA',1999),(3,'\'68 is an American rock duo that formed in 2013.
